## Current Community Partners

* [Court Watch NOLA](https://www.courtwatchnola.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting transparency, equity, and justice in the criminal court system. By training volunteers to observe and report on thousands of criminal court cases a year, Court Watch NOLA works to ensure judges, prosecutors, public defenders, sheriff deputies, police officers, and other criminal justice actors are doing their jobs professionally, transparently, fairly, and economically. We work with Court Watch NOLA to build data systems that collect, search, and report on criminal court data to improve transparency and oversight.

* [Eye on Surveillance](https://eyeonsurveillance.org/) is a group of community members and organizations working to reduce the use of and improve the oversight of surveillance tools such as facial recognition. We are working with EoS to improve access to City Council meeting proceedings, in order to help citizens be better informed about important issues facing them.

* [The Data Center](https://www.datacenterresearch.org/) is a fully independent nonprofit, expert at bringing data together from multiple sources. In doing so, we are uniquely able to step beyond the limits of analyzing data from just one perspective and take a 360â€“degree look at issues that matter most to our region from the government, business, nonprofit, and community perspective. In these ways The Data Center realizes its mission to build prosperous, inclusive, and sustainable communities through neutral and objective data and analysis for informed decision making.

* [The City of New Orleans Office of Information Technology and Innovation](https://nola.gov/iti/) facilitates effective, cost efficient use of technology by spearheading the assessment and deployment of technology based business management solutions, and service delivery strategies.

* [Families Helping Families](https://fhfofgno.org/) is a family-directed resource center that provides information and referral, training and education, and peer-to-peer support on issues related to disability. FHF of GNO is also home to the Louisiana Parent Training and Information Center, a federal education grant that provides training and support to families throughout Louisiana on special education and transition topics. Our work with FHF was to develop a chatbot tool to enable easier access to information for parents of children with disabilities.
